# anonymous-video-upload (work in progress)
This project is meant to provide a simple command line tool to upload videos anonymously to video sharing site bianco.tv, which can host videos without signup

The following video files will be supported: .mp4, .mov (basically everything that [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html) can handle)

Site: [Biancotv unlimited video upload](https://bianco.tv)
This is what will be automated: [Video upload](https://bianco.tv/upload/)
